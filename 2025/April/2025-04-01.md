## Fixing Apache Ant DeployTask Issue in Tomcat

### Issue
While running `ant clean dist`, the build failed with the following error:

```
BUILD FAILED
/project/path/build.xml:65: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/project/path/build.xml:173: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/project/path/build.xml:175: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/project/path/apps/admin/build.xml:39: taskdef class org.apache.catalina.ant.DeployTask cannot be found
```

### Resolution
The issue was due to an incorrect Tomcat path. After correcting the Tomcat path in the environment variables and ensuring `catalina-ant.jar` was properly referenced, the build executed successfully.

### Steps Taken
1. Verified that `catalina-ant.jar` exists in the Tomcat `server/lib` directory.
2. Corrected the `CATALINA_HOME` path.
3. Updated `build.xml` to include the correct classpath:
   ```xml
   <taskdef name="deploy" classname="org.apache.catalina.ant.DeployTask">
       <classpath>
           <pathelement location="/opt/tomcat-5.0.17/server/lib/catalina-ant.jar"/>
       </classpath>
   </taskdef>
   ```
4. Ensured Ant and Tomcat environment variables were correctly set:
   ```bash
   export CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat-5.0.17
   export ANT_HOME=/path/to/ant
   export PATH=$ANT_HOME/bin:$CATALINA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```

### Conclusion
After these fixes, `ant clean dist` executed without errors.
