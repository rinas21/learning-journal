# **Configuring SSH Authentication for GitHub**

## **Issue Faced**

1. GitHub removed password authentication for HTTPS in August 2021.
2. SSH authentication was not set up for GitHub.
3. Attempted to use `id_rsa`, but it was linked to a different email.
4. The newly generated SSH key (`github_id_ed25519`) was not saved in `~/.ssh/`.

---

## **Solution: Setting Up SSH Authentication for GitHub**

### **Step 1: Generate a New SSH Key for GitHub**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mohomadrinas00@gmail.com"
```
- When prompted, enter the filename as:
  ```
  github_id_ed25519
  ```
- Leave the passphrase **empty** (or set one for extra security).

---

### **Step 2: Move the SSH Key to the Correct Directory**
If the key is missing from `~/.ssh/`, move it manually:

```bash
mv github_id_ed25519* ~/.ssh/
```

Verify it exists:
```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

---

### **Step 3: Start SSH Agent and Add the New Key**

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/github_id_ed25519
```

Verify that the key is added:
```bash
ssh-add -l
```
Expected output:
```
256 SHA256:BPhKMXxFF94wo3VJW2UbjsuxwDpFuI4DtDAns4cVIoc mohomadrinas00@gmail.com (ED25519)
```

---

### **Step 4: Configure SSH for GitHub**
Edit (or create) the SSH configuration file:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```
Add the following lines:
```
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_id_ed25519
```
Save the file (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

---

### **Step 5: Add SSH Key to GitHub**
Retrieve the public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/github_id_ed25519.pub
```
- Copy the output.
- Go to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys**.
- Click **New SSH Key**, paste it, and save.

---

### **Step 6: Test SSH Connection**

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
If successful, you should see:
```
Hi git_id! You've successfully authenticated...
```

---

### **Step 7: Update Git Remote (If Needed)**

If you previously cloned the repository using HTTPS, update the remote URL to SSH:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:git_id/learning-journal.git
```
Verify the change:
```bash
git remote -v
```

---

### **Step 8: Push Changes Without Password**

Now, you can push changes without entering a password:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
