# Downloading Files from Google Drive using `gdown`

If you are trying to download a file from Google Drive using the `gdown` tool and facing issues executing the command, follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Install `gdown` (if not installed)

If you don't have `gdown` installed yet, you can install it using `pip3`:

```bash
pip3 install gdown
```

## Step 2: Use Python to Download the File

Instead of using `gdown` directly in the terminal, you can use Python to download the file. Follow these steps:

1. Create a Python script (e.g., `download_file.py`) with the following content:

    ```python
    import gdown

    url = "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1q3IIXys6ofSi0WeXSIOocs1aKaqOvcZK"
    output = "ds01archi.mp4"
    gdown.download(url, output, quiet=False)
    ```

2. Run the script with Python:

    ```bash
    python3 download_file.py
    ```

This will download the file to your current directory as `ds01archi.mp4`.

## Step 3: Alternative - Use `gdown` with Python 3

You can also use the following command to invoke `gdown` through Python:

```bash
python3 -m gdown "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1q3IIXys6ofSi0WeXSIOocs1aKaqOvcZK"
```

**Note:** If you encounter issues with direct execution of `gdown`, using a Python script as shown above should resolve the issue.
