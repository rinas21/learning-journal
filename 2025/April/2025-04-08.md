## Issue: Java Virtual Machine Initialization Error

### Error Message
```
There was an error trying to initialize the HPI library.
Please check your installation, HotSpot does not work correctly
when installed in the JDK 1.2 Linux Production Release, or
with any JDK 1.1.x release.
Could not create the Java virtual machine.
```

### Observations
- Running `java -version` initially failed with the above error.
- After resolving dependencies, the following version was confirmed:
    ```
    java version "1.5.0_20"
    Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_20-b02)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 1.5.0_20-b02, mixed mode)
    ```

### Resolution Steps
1. Installed required dependencies:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install libnsl
     sudo yum install glibc.i686
     sudo yum install libX11.i686
     ```

2. Verified the Java installation and confirmed the issue was resolved.

### Notes
- Ensure all required 32-bit libraries are installed when working with older Java versions on 64-bit systems.
- Consider upgrading to a more recent Java version if possible for better compatibility and security.
