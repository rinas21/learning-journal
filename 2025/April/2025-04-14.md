# Python Troubleshooting and Installation Summary

This document summarizes the issues encountered and troubleshooting steps taken based on the provided command history. It also provides guidance on proper Python installation.

## Issues Encountered

1.  **Terminal Failure After Changing Python Version:**
    * After installing Python 3.14 and setting it as the default using `update-alternatives`, both `gnome-terminal` and `terminator` failed to launch.
    * Errors were related to missing or incompatible Python libraries (`psutil` and `gi`).
    * `gnome-terminal` also had a typo in it's shebang.
2.  **Incompatible Python Libraries:**
    * The alpha version of Python 3.14 caused incompatibility issues with `psutil` and `gi` libraries, which are essential for the terminal applications.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1.  **Corrected `gnome-terminal` Shebang:**
    * Used `sudo vim /usr/bin/gnome-terminal` to correct the shebang from `/usri/bin/python3` to `/usr/bin/python3`.
2.  **Switched Python Versions:**
    * Used `sudo update-alternatives --config python3` to switch back to a stable Python version (Python 3.10).
3.  **Reinstalled Python Libraries:**
    * `sudo apt-get install --reinstall python3-psutil gir1.2-glib-2.0 python3-gi` was used to reinstall the python modules that the terminal applications use.
4.  **Rebooted the system:**
    * Reboots where used in an attempt to solve the issue.

## Proper Python Installation and Version Management

1.  **Adding the DeadSnakes PPA (for newer Python versions):**
    * `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa` adds the DeadSnakes PPA, which provides newer Python versions.
    * `sudo apt update` updates the package list.

2.  **Installing a Specific Python Version:**
    * `sudo apt-get install python3.11` (or `python3.14`) installs the desired Python version.

3.  **Managing Python Versions with `update-alternatives` (Use with Caution):**
    * `sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.11 2` registers a Python version with `update-alternatives`.
    * `sudo update-alternatives --config python3` allows you to select the default Python version.
    * **Recommendation:** Avoid changing the system's default Python version unless absolutely necessary.

4.  **Using Virtual Environments (Recommended):**
    * For project-specific Python versions and dependencies, use virtual environments:
        * `python3.14 -m venv my_env` creates a virtual environment.
        * `source my_env/bin/activate` activates the environment.
        * `deactivate` deactivates the environment.
    * Virtual environments isolate project dependencies and prevent system-wide conflicts.
    * This is the recommended way to use python 3.14.

## Key Recommendations

* **Use virtual environments** for project-specific Python versions.
* **Avoid changing the system's default Python version** unless you fully understand the consequences.
* **Stick to stable Python versions** for system-wide use.
* When using `update-alternatives` ensure that the path to the python executable is correct.
* If terminal problems occur after python changes, switch back to a stable python version, and reinstall any broken python modules.
