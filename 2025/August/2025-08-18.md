# Docker Compose: `up --build` Command

## Overview

`docker compose up --build` is used to build (or rebuild) and start Docker containers as defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. This ensures your containers use the latest code and configuration.

## Command Breakdown

| Command                        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `docker compose up`            | Starts containers using existing images.                                    |
| `docker compose up --build`    | **Rebuilds** images before starting containers (ensures latest changes).    |

---

## When to Use `--build`

### ✅ Use `--build` when:
- You’ve updated your `Dockerfile`.
- You’ve changed your application code and need it reflected in the container.
- You suspect the existing image is outdated or corrupted.

### ❌ Avoid `--build` when:
- No changes have been made to the code or `Dockerfile`.
- You want to save time (rebuilding can be slow).

---

## Example Workflow

### 1. First Run (or after changes):

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
_Builds images and starts containers with the latest changes._

---

### 2. Normal Start (no changes):

```bash
docker compose up
```
_Uses cached images for faster startup._

---

### 3. After Code or Dockerfile Updates:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
_Ensures containers use the latest code and configuration._

---

## Tips

- Use `--build` sparingly to save time during development.
- To rebuild only a specific service, use:
    ```bash
    docker compose build <service_name>
    docker compose up
    ```
- Check your `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` for changes before deciding to rebuild.
