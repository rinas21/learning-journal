# How to Enable Swap Memory on Linux

If your system shows `Swap: 0B 0B 0B`, it means there is no active swap space. Follow these steps to check and enable swap.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check If a Swap Partition Exists
Run:
```sh
lsblk | grep swap
```
If no output appears, you don't have a swap partition.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Check If Swap Is Configured in `/etc/fstab`
Run:
```sh
cat /etc/fstab | grep swap
```
If there is no output, swap is not set up.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Swap File (If No Swap Exists)
If there is no swap partition, create a swap file manually:

### **Step 1: Create a 2GB Swap File**
```sh
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile  # Create a 2GB swap file
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile        # Secure it
sudo mkswap /swapfile           # Format as swap
sudo swapon /swapfile           # Enable swap
```

### **Step 2: Verify Swap is Active**
```sh
free -mh
swapon --show
```

### **Step 3: Make Swap Persistent**
To make the swap file persist after reboot, add this line to `/etc/fstab`:
```sh
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ If You Have a Swap Partition, Enable It
If `lsblk` shows a swap partition (e.g., `/dev/sdX`), activate it with:
```sh
sudo swapon /dev/sdX  # Replace /dev/sdX with the actual partition name
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Disable Swap Temporarily (Optional)
If you need to disable swap for a while, use:
```sh
sudo swapoff -a
```
To re-enable it:
```sh
sudo swapon -a
```

---

Now your system should have active swap memory! üöÄ
