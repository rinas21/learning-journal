# Creating a Temporary Admin User in Keycloak  

To create a temporary admin user, use the following command in the **Keycloak bin directory**:  

```sh
bin/kc.sh bootstrap-admin user
```
This will prompt you to enter the required username and password interactively.

Alternatively, you can specify credentials directly:
```sh
bin/kc.sh bootstrap-admin user --username tmpadm --password:env PASS_VAR
```

* This creates an admin user with the username tmpadm.
* The password is retrieved from the environment variable PASS_VAR.


### Install MySQL Workbench Manually

Since you are on **Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)**, MySQL Workbench may not be available in the standard MySQL APT repository. Instead, you can install it manually using **Snap**.

#### **Steps to Install:**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   sudo snap install mysql-workbench-community
   ```
3. Wait for the installation to complete.

This will install **MySQL Workbench** from the Snap package manager.

#### **Verification:**
After installation, you can launch MySQL Workbench by running:
```sh
mysql-workbench-community
```
or by searching for **MySQL Workbench** in your application menu.

If you encounter any issues, ensure that **Snap** is installed on your system by running:
```sh
snap --version
```
