# Creating a Temporary Admin User in Keycloak  

To create a temporary admin user, use the following command in the **Keycloak bin directory**:  

```sh
bin/kc.sh bootstrap-admin user
```
This will prompt you to enter the required username and password interactively.

Alternatively, you can specify credentials directly:
```sh
bin/kc.sh bootstrap-admin user --username tmpadm --password:env PASS_VAR
```

* This creates an admin user with the username tmpadm.
* The password is retrieved from the environment variable PASS_VAR.
