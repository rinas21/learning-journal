### Keycloak Configuration for SSL Requirement
* If you encounter an error regarding the requirement for HTTPS in Keycloak, you can disable the SSL requirement by running the following commands. This should be done after starting Keycloak in development mode.

### Steps to Resolve the HTTPS Required Error
1. Start Keycloak in development mode:
```bash
./kc.sh start-dev
```
2. Once Keycloak is running, use the following commands to configure the credentials and update the realm settings:
```bash
./kcadm.sh config credentials --server http://0.0.0.0:8081 --realm master --user temp-admin
./kcadm.sh update realms/master -s sslRequired=NONE --server http://0.0.0.0:8081
```

### Explanation:
1. The first command sets up the Keycloak admin credentials.
2. The second command updates the Keycloak realm to disable the SSL requirement.
3. This will resolve the issue where HTTPS is required but you are running Keycloak in a non-HTTPS environment.
