* The ORDER BY clause does not work with DISTINCT in that way. If you want to order the results by the name column, you should simply use:
```sql
SELECT * FROM role ORDER BY name;
```
If you want to get distinct role names (though in this case, they are already unique), you can use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM role ORDER BY name;
```

# Network Interfaces and Their Levels & Usage

A **network interface** is a point of connection between a device and a network, enabling communication through the sending and receiving of data packets. These interfaces can be **physical (wired/wireless)** or **virtual (software-based)**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Network Interfaces

### üîπ Physical Interfaces
These are hardware-based interfaces found in networking devices:

- **Ethernet (Wired) Interface** (`eth0`, `ens33`, etc.)
  - Used for LAN/WAN communication through wired connections (RJ45 cables).
  - Common in desktops, laptops, and servers.

- **Wi-Fi (Wireless) Interface** (`wlan0`, `wlp2s0`, etc.)
  - Used for wireless communication with access points and routers.
  - Found in mobile devices, laptops, and embedded systems.

- **Loopback Interface** (`lo`)
  - A virtual interface used for self-communication within the same system.
  - Typically assigned IP **127.0.0.1**.

- **Fiber Optic Interface**
  - Uses fiber optics for high-speed network connections.
  - Used in data centers, ISPs, and backbone networks.

- **Cellular Interfaces** (`ppp0`, `wwan0`)
  - Used for mobile network communication (3G, 4G, 5G).
  - Found in IoT devices, mobile hotspots, and embedded systems.

### üîπ Virtual Interfaces
Software-based interfaces used in virtualization, security, and tunneling:

- **Bridge Interface** (`br0`)
  - Combines multiple network interfaces into one.
  - Used in virtualization and container networking.

- **VLAN Interface** (`vlan10`, `vlan20`)
  - Logical separation of networks using the same physical interface.
  - Used in enterprise networks for segmentation.

- **Tunnel Interface** (`tun0`, `tap0`)
  - Used for VPNs (OpenVPN, WireGuard).
  - `tun` (Layer 3) for routed VPNs.
  - `tap` (Layer 2) for bridged VPNs.

- **Docker/Container Interfaces** (`docker0`, `cni0`)
  - Used in containerized applications.
  - Connects Docker containers to host networks.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Network Interface Levels & Their Usage

Network interfaces operate at different **OSI model layers**:

- **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)**  
  - Deals with the actual physical medium (Ethernet, fiber optics, etc.) used for communication.

- **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**  
  - Responsible for error-free communication between devices (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, VLANs, etc.).

- **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**  
  - Handles routing and addressing (IP, IP routing, VPN tunnels, etc.).

- **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**  
  - Ensures reliable data transmission (TCP, UDP).

- **Layer 5 (Session Layer)**  
  - Manages sessions between devices (e.g., TLS for secure communication).

- **Layer 6 (Presentation Layer)**  
  - Translates data for application processing (SSL/TLS encryption).

- **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**  
  - Interfaces directly with end-user applications (HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Usage of Network Interfaces
- **Physical Interfaces** are used for actual communication over the network (wired or wireless).
- **Virtual Interfaces** are used for network management, segmentation, VPNs, and containerized environments.
