# PostgreSQL Setup Issues

## Issue 1: PostgreSQL Cluster Setup
**Error:**
Warning: No existing cluster is suitable as a default target. Please see man pg_wrapper(1) how to specify one. Error: You must install at least one postgresql-client-<version> package
**Cause:**  
PostgreSQL client is missing, and no default cluster is set up for PostgreSQL.

**Resolution:**  
You need to initialize a PostgreSQL cluster and ensure that the PostgreSQL client is properly installed. You can try:
- Installing the required PostgreSQL client package with `sudo apt install postgresql-client-<version>`.

## Issue 2: PostgreSQL Service Status
**Command:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo systemctl status postgresql
● postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; enabled; vendor pr>
     Active: active (exited) since Sun 2025-02-23 18:09:28 +0530; 2s ago
    Process: 30719 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
    Main PID: 30719 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 2ms

```
**Cause:**
The PostgreSQL service is in an "exited" state because it did not initialize a proper database cluster. The service is started, but it does not actively run the PostgreSQL server.

**Resolution:**
Ensure that PostgreSQL is fully initialized by setting up a database cluster. This can be done using pg_createcluster.

**Cause:**
The PostgreSQL service is in an "exited" state because it did not initialize a proper database cluster. The service is started, but it does not actively run the PostgreSQL server.

**Resolution:**
Ensure that PostgreSQL is fully initialized by setting up a database cluster. This can be done using pg_createcluster.

## Issue 3: Connection Failure
Command:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```
```bash
psql: error: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed: No such file or directory
Is the server running locally and accepting connections on that socket?

```
**Cause:**
The PostgreSQL server is not running or the socket file does not exist.

**Resolution:**
Ensure the PostgreSQL server is running and has a valid database cluster created. You may need to reinitialize the cluster or start the server correctly.

## Issue 4: PostgreSQL Cluster Initialization Failure
Command:

```bash
sudo pg_createcluster 17 main --start
```
Error: no initdb program for version 17 found

**Cause:**
The required initialization program (initdb) for version 17 is missing.

**Resolution:**
Verify that the PostgreSQL version and its components are correctly installed. You may need to install additional packages for version 17, such as postgresql-17.

## Issue 5: Invalid SQL Commands
Commands:

```sql
show databases;
show db;
```

```sql
ERROR: unrecognized configuration parameter "databases"
ERROR: unrecognized configuration parameter "db"
```
**Cause:**
These are not valid SQL commands in PostgreSQL.

**Resolution:**
To list databases in PostgreSQL, use:
```sql
\l
```
```sql
SELECT datname FROM pg_database;
```
