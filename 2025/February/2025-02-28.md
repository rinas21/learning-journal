### Copy the SQL File to the Container:
* First, copy the number_cache.sql file from your local machine to the Docker container. You can use docker cp for this:

```bash
docker cp /tmp/number_cache.sql mysql-container:/tmp/number_cache.sql
```
This will copy the number_cache.sql file from your /tmp directory into the /tmp directory of your running mysql-container.

# Checking Port Availability Using Netcat (`nc`)

Netcat (`nc`) is a powerful networking tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as scanning ports, connecting to remote systems, and troubleshooting network issues. This note explains how to use `nc` to check if a specific port (e.g., MySQL's default port) is open on your local machine or a remote server.

## Command Breakdown: `nc -zv 127.0.0.1 3306`

### 1. **`nc`**:
   - Stands for **Netcat**.
   - It’s a versatile networking tool often referred to as the "Swiss army knife" of networking.

### 2. **`-z`** (Scan for Open Ports):
   - This option tells Netcat to **scan** the given port(s) without establishing a full connection.
   - It checks if the port is open (i.e., a service is listening on that port).

### 3. **`-v`** (Verbose Mode):
   - Makes `nc` output more detailed information about the connection attempt.
   - Useful for understanding whether the port is open or closed.

### 4. **`127.0.0.1`**:
   - The **loopback address**, which refers to the local machine.
   - You can replace this with any IP address (e.g., a remote server’s IP) to test ports on other systems.

### 5. **`3306`**:
   - The **port number** to test. In this case, port 3306 is the default port for MySQL.

## Example Scenarios:

### 1. **MySQL is Running**:
If MySQL is running on port 3306, you will see:

```bash
Connection to 127.0.0.1 3306 port [tcp/mysql] succeeded!
```

This means that MySQL is accepting connections on port 3306.

### 2. **MySQL is Not Running**:
If MySQL is not running on port 3306, you will see:
```bash
nc: connect to 127.0.0.1 port 3306 (tcp) failed: Connection refused

```

This means either:
- MySQL is not running.
- The port is blocked by a firewall.
- The service is not listening on that port.

## Checking Multiple Ports:

You can also check multiple ports at once by listing them after the IP address. For example:

```bash
nc -zv 127.0.0.1 3306 8080 443
```
This command will check if ports 3306 (MySQL), 8080 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS) are open on 127.0.0.1.

# Git Bisect Process to Debug Issue

## Steps:

### 1. **Start Git Bisect**
   The `git bisect start` command initiates the bisecting process, which allows you to perform a binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug. This is useful when you know a bug exists but don't know which commit caused it.

   ```bash
   git bisect start
   ```
### 2. **Checkout Version 2.0.54 (Bad Commit)**
    In this step, we checkout the version where the bug was introduced (the "bad" commit). We then mark this version as bad using git bisect bad. This tells Git to start the search for the bad commit from this point.

```bash

git checkout 2.0.54
git bisect bad
```
### 3. **Get the Top-Level Directory**
    `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` is used to print the top-level directory of your Git repository. This helps you understand the root directory where your Git repository is initialized. It's useful if you're unsure of your current working directory within the project.

```bash

git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```
### 4. **Tag Information**
    The git describe --tags command retrieves the most recent tag that is reachable from a given commit. This helps you understand the closest version or release associated with a commit. It's useful when you want to track which tag the current commit belongs to.

```bash

git describe --tags e86d6b276bc4d588575d6ba02716b824686c78cb
```
### 5. **Checkout Version 2.0.25 (Good Commit)**
    After marking the bad commit, we then checkout the last known good version (the "good" commit). This helps to narrow down where the issue occurred. We use git bisect good to indicate that this commit is working correctly.

```bash

git checkout 2.0.25
git bisect good
```
### 6. **Review Commit Log**
    To review changes in the codebase and potentially identify which commit introduced the bug, use git log --oneline -- .. This will display the commit history for the current directory. It's helpful for tracing through changes between the "good" and "bad" commits.

```bash

git log --oneline -- .
```
