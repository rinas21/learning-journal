### Copy the SQL File to the Container:
* First, copy the number_cache.sql file from your local machine to the Docker container. You can use docker cp for this:

```bash
docker cp /tmp/number_cache.sql mysql-container:/tmp/number_cache.sql
```
This will copy the number_cache.sql file from your /tmp directory into the /tmp directory of your running mysql-container.

# Checking Port Availability Using Netcat (`nc`)

Netcat (`nc`) is a powerful networking tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as scanning ports, connecting to remote systems, and troubleshooting network issues. This note explains how to use `nc` to check if a specific port (e.g., MySQL's default port) is open on your local machine or a remote server.

## Command Breakdown: `nc -zv 127.0.0.1 3306`

### 1. **`nc`**:
   - Stands for **Netcat**.
   - It’s a versatile networking tool often referred to as the "Swiss army knife" of networking.

### 2. **`-z`** (Scan for Open Ports):
   - This option tells Netcat to **scan** the given port(s) without establishing a full connection.
   - It checks if the port is open (i.e., a service is listening on that port).

### 3. **`-v`** (Verbose Mode):
   - Makes `nc` output more detailed information about the connection attempt.
   - Useful for understanding whether the port is open or closed.

### 4. **`127.0.0.1`**:
   - The **loopback address**, which refers to the local machine.
   - You can replace this with any IP address (e.g., a remote server’s IP) to test ports on other systems.

### 5. **`3306`**:
   - The **port number** to test. In this case, port 3306 is the default port for MySQL.

## Example Scenarios:

### 1. **MySQL is Running**:
If MySQL is running on port 3306, you will see:

```bash
Connection to 127.0.0.1 3306 port [tcp/mysql] succeeded!
```

This means that MySQL is accepting connections on port 3306.

### 2. **MySQL is Not Running**:
If MySQL is not running on port 3306, you will see:
```bash
nc: connect to 127.0.0.1 port 3306 (tcp) failed: Connection refused

```
