## SSH Configuration for Connection Timeout and Security Settings

### SSH Server Configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`)

The following settings help manage timeouts, session limits, and authentication attempts for SSH connections:

### Configuration Settings:

1. **Key Exchange Algorithms**:
    ```bash
    KexAlgorithms -diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
    ```
    - This configuration disables certain key exchange algorithms (`diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`, `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1`, and `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1`).
    - It is used to enforce stronger encryption algorithms and prevent weak ones.

2. **Max Startups**:
    ```bash
    MaxStartups 10:30:60
    ```
    - Controls the maximum number of simultaneous unauthenticated connections to the SSH server.
    - `10`: Maximum number of unauthenticated connections.
    - `30`: Percentage of connections rejected once the limit is reached.
    - `60`: The maximum number of unauthenticated connections after which the server blocks new ones.

3. **Max Sessions**:
    ```bash
    MaxSessions 10
    ```
    - Limits the number of open sessions per connection.
    - In this case, a maximum of 10 sessions can be opened per SSH connection.

4. **Max Authentication Tries**:
    ```bash
    MaxAuthTries 4
    ```
    - Limits the number of authentication attempts allowed before disconnecting the client.
    - After 4 failed attempts, the server disconnects the client.

5. **Login Grace Time**:
    ```bash
    LoginGraceTime 60
    ```
    - Specifies the time allowed for a client to authenticate after connecting.
    - The client has 60 seconds to authenticate before the connection is closed.

6. **Client Alive Interval**:
    ```bash
    ClientAliveInterval 300
    ```
    - Controls how often the server sends a "keep-alive" message to the client to prevent disconnection due to inactivity.
    - The server will send a message every 300 seconds (5 minutes).

7. **Client Alive Count Max**:
    ```bash
    ClientAliveCountMax 1
    ```
    - Specifies how many "keep-alive" messages can be missed before the server disconnects the client.
    - With a value of `1`, the server will disconnect the client if one "keep-alive" message is missed.

### Recommended Adjustments for Longer Inactivity Period:

- **To allow a longer idle period** before disconnecting:
    ```bash
    ClientAliveInterval 600  # 10 minutes
    ClientAliveCountMax 3    # Allow up to 3 missed messages before disconnecting
    ```

### Apply Changes:

1. After modifying the `sshd_config` file, restart the SSH service to apply the changes:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart sshd
    ```

---

By adjusting these settings, you can control connection timeouts, improve security, and manage idle time more effectively.
