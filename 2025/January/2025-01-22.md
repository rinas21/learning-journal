## Apache HTTP Server Troubleshooting Notes

## Common Commands

### Syntax Check
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  ./httpd -t
  ```
- **Purpose:** Validates the syntax of Apache configuration files without restarting the server.
- **Benefits:**
  - Quickly identifies errors in configuration.
  - Pinpoints the exact file and line number of the issue.

### Additional Options
- **Dump Virtual Hosts:**
  ```bash
  ./httpd -t -D DUMP_VHOSTS
  ```
  Lists all configured virtual hosts and their respective settings.

- **Dump Modules:**
  ```bash
  ./httpd -t -D DUMP_MODULES
  ```
  Displays all loaded Apache modules.

- **Dump Runtime Configuration:**
  ```bash
  ./httpd -t -D DUMP_RUN_CFG
  ```
  Outputs the runtime configuration, useful for debugging.

## Issue Encountered: `SSLSessionCache cannot occur within <VirtualHost>`

### Error Description
- **Error Message:**
  ```
  AH00526: Syntax error on line 209 of /path/to/httpd.conf:
  SSLSessionCache cannot occur within <VirtualHost> section
  ```

- **Cause:**
  The `SSLSessionCache` directive was placed inside a `<VirtualHost>` block, which is not allowed. This directive should be in the global context.

### Resolution Steps
1. Open the Apache configuration file for editing:
   ```bash
   vim /path/to/httpd.conf
   ```

2. Locate the `SSLSessionCache` directive.

3. Move the directive outside of any `<VirtualHost>` blocks, typically near the top of the configuration file.

4. Save and close the file.

5. Validate the syntax:
   ```bash
   ./httpd -t
   ```

6. Restart the Apache server:
   ```bash
   ./httpd -k restart
   ```

## Debugging Logs

### Check the Error Log
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  cat /path/to/apache/logs/error_log
  ```
- **Purpose:** Provides detailed error messages and logs related to server operations.
- **Example Logs:**
  ```
  [Fri Jan 10 11:42:11.283516 2025] [ssl:warn] [pid 21313:tid 21313] AH01873: Init: Session Cache is not configured [hint: SSLSessionCache]
  [Fri Jan 10 12:27:21.218230 2025] [mpm_event:notice] [pid 21414:tid 21414] AH00491: caught SIGTERM, shutting down
  ```

### Key Warnings and Notices
- **`AH01873`:**
  - Warning: Session Cache is not configured.
  - **Hint:** Ensure `SSLSessionCache` is configured in the global context.

- **`AH00491`:**
  - Notice: The server received a signal to terminate (e.g., `SIGTERM`).

---

## Tips for Future Troubleshooting
- Always use `httpd -t` after making configuration changes.
- Check logs regularly for warnings or errors.
- Keep configuration directives in the appropriate context (global vs. `<VirtualHost>`).

## SSL Certificate Creation and Validation

## 1. Generate a New Private Key
To generate a new private key using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out /hms/installs/apache/key/enum_hsenidmobile_com.key 2048
 
 ```

## 2. Create a New CSR (Certificate Signing Request)

 ```bash
openssl req -new -key /hms/installs/apache/key/enum_hsenidmobile_com.key -out /hms/installs/apache/key/enum_hsenidmobile_com.csr
```
## 3. Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA)

Once the CSR is generated, submit it to your Certificate Authority (CA) of choice (e.g., Let's Encrypt, DigiCert) to obtain a signed certificate. The CA will provide:

- `.crt` file: This is the signed certificate.
- `.chain` or `.intermediate` certificate file (optional): This is the intermediate certificate that links your certificate to the CA's root certificate.

### Example:
After submitting the CSR to the CA, you will receive files like:
- `enum_hsenidmobile_com.crt` (signed certificate)
- `enum_hsenidmobile_com_chain.crt` (intermediate certificate)

## 4. Install the SSL Certificate

Once you have received the certificate files from your CA, you'll need to install them on your server.

### Update Apache SSL Configuration

Edit the Apache configuration to include the following:

```apache
SSLEngine On
SSLCertificateFile /hms/installs/apache/key/enum_hsenidmobile_com.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /hms/installs/apache/key/enum_hsenidmobile_com.key
SSLCertificateChainFile /hms/installs/apache/key/enum_hsenidmobile_com_chain.crt
```
