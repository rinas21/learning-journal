1. We need to locate a file owned by user bandit7, group bandit6, and is exactly 33 bytes in size. Here's the exact find command:

```bash
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
```

 - Search the entire server.
 - type f: Look for regular files.
 - user bandit7: Files owned by user bandit7.
 - group bandit6: Files owned by group bandit6.
 - size 33c: Files that are 33 bytes in size (c stands for bytes).
 - 2>/dev/null: Suppress permission denied errors.
