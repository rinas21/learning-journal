1. We need to locate a file owned by user bandit7, group bandit6, and is exactly 33 bytes in size. Here's the exact find command:

```bash
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
```

 - Search the entire server.
 - type f: Look for regular files.
 - user bandit7: Files owned by user bandit7.
 - group bandit6: Files owned by group bandit6.
 - size 33c: Files that are 33 bytes in size (c stands for bytes).
 - 2>/dev/null: Suppress permission denied errors.

## SSH with a Custom Port

```bash
ssh -p PORT_NUMBER username@hostname
```
##  SSH with ProxyJump (Jump Host)

### If you need to use an intermediary server (jump host) to reach your destination server, you can use the -J option.

```bash
ssh -J jump_user@jump_host destination_user@destination_host
```

## Why We Need Proxy Configuration in Maven's settings.xml

<p>The proxy configuration in the <code>settings.xml</code> file is essential for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Network Access Control:</strong> 
    <p>If your network is behind a corporate firewall or proxy server, Maven needs this configuration to route its requests through the proxy. This allows Maven to access remote repositories (such as Maven Central or internal repositories) and download dependencies or plugins, especially when direct access to the internet is restricted.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Security and Monitoring:</strong> 
    <p>Proxies are often used to monitor and control network traffic for security and auditing purposes. By routing Maven's traffic through a proxy, your organization can track and control access to external resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Optimized Performance (Caching):</strong> 
    <p>Proxies can cache responses (like dependencies or artifacts), which can speed up build times when accessing commonly used resources. If Maven has already downloaded a dependency once, the proxy can serve it from the cache instead of downloading it again.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bypass Local Restrictions:</strong> 
    <p>The <code>nonProxyHosts</code> field allows you to define exceptions where Maven doesn't use the proxy, such as for internal repositories or local network addresses. This ensures that Maven can still communicate directly with trusted hosts without needing to route everything through the proxy.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> 
    <p>Configuring the proxy in the <code>settings.xml</code> ensures that all developers and build environments within your organization are using the same proxy configuration, providing consistent behavior across different machines or systems.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, this configuration is required when Maven needs to access the internet via a proxy server, ensuring smooth communication with remote repositories and better control over network traffic.</p>

<h3>Example Proxy Configuration in settings.xml</h3>

<pre>
<code>
&lt;proxy&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;optional&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;active&gt;true&lt;/active&gt;
  &lt;protocol&gt;http&lt;/protocol&gt;
  &lt;host&gt;proxy.host.net&lt;/host&gt;
  &lt;port&gt;80&lt;/port&gt;
  &lt;nonProxyHosts&gt;local.net|some.host.com&lt;/nonProxyHosts&gt;
&lt;/proxy&gt;

&lt;/settings&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>Example Path to settings.xml:</p>

<pre>
<code>
/opt/mvn-3-0-3/conf
</code>
