### CPU Cycle and its Relation to Time

- A **CPU cycle** represents the time taken for the CPU to perform a basic operation, such as fetching, decoding, or executing an instruction.
- It is not measured in seconds but is linked to the CPU's clock speed.

#### Relation to Clock Speed
- **Clock Speed**: Measured in Hertz (Hz), it defines how many cycles the CPU can perform per second.
- Example: A CPU with a clock speed of **3 GHz** (3 billion cycles per second) has a single cycle duration of approximately **0.33 nanoseconds** (1 / 3 billion seconds).

#### Key Takeaways
- A CPU cycle is a fundamental unit of computation time for the processor.
- The faster the clock speed, the shorter the duration of each cycle, resulting in quicker processing.
