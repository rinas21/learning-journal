## Keycloak Login Error: `expired_code` & Non-Secure Cookie Context

## Issue Overview
When using Keycloak, you may encounter the following log warnings related to authentication errors and non-secure cookies:

### Example Logs:

```Log

2025-01-27 01:51:15,045 WARN  [org.keycloak.cookie.DefaultCookieProvider] (executor-thread-3) Non-secure context detected; cookies are not secured, and will not be available in cross-origin POST requests
2025-01-27 01:51:15,049 WARN  [org.keycloak.events] (executor-thread-3) type="LOGIN_ERROR", realmId="9821b5e9-f662-4cc9-bc87-19019604c1a8", realmName="master", clientId="security-admin-console", userId="null", ipAddress="172.16.1.234", error="expired_code", restart_after_timeout="true"

```


### Causes:
1. **Expired Authentication Code**:
   - The error `expired_code` suggests that the authentication code has expired. This can occur due to session timeouts, clock misalignment, or prolonged inactivity.

2. **Non-Secure Cookie Context**:
   - The warning `Non-secure context detected; cookies are not secured` indicates that Keycloak is not using secure cookies (i.e., cookies are not sent over HTTPS). This can affect cross-origin POST requests and the availability of cookies.

## Solutions

### 1. Clear Cache:
   - **Browser Cache**: Clear the cache in your browser to ensure there are no expired tokens still being used.
   - **Keycloak Cache**: If the issue persists, clear the cache on the Keycloak server to remove any stale data.

### 2. Ensure Secure Cookies:
   - Check and update your Keycloak configuration to ensure cookies are set as `Secure` (only sent over HTTPS) and `HttpOnly` (not accessible via JavaScript).
   - This can be done by modifying the following in your Keycloak server configuration:
     - Set `cookie.secure=true` and `cookie.httpOnly=true` in the `standalone.xml` (or equivalent) file for your Keycloak installation.

### 3. Adjust Token Expiry or Session Timeout:
   - Review the settings for token expiry in Keycloak. If the authentication codes are expiring too quickly, you can increase the lifespan of the access tokens and refresh tokens.
   - Example of how to adjust token expiry settings:
     - Navigate to `Realm Settings > Tokens` in the Keycloak Admin Console and adjust the **Access Token Lifespan** and **Refresh Token Lifespan**.
  
### 4. Time Synchronization:
   - Ensure that your Keycloak server and clients are synchronized with a reliable time source to avoid discrepancies in token expiry times.

### 5. Restart Keycloak:
   - After making the changes, restart the Keycloak server to ensure the new configurations are applied.

## Additional Notes
- If you continue to encounter this issue after performing the above steps, consider reviewing your Keycloak session settings or network configurations.
- Make sure that any reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or load balancers are correctly handling HTTPS and forwarding secure cookies.

## Example Keycloak Configuration Adjustments:

### Secure Cookies:
To enforce secure cookies in Keycloak, update the configuration as follows:
- In the `standalone.xml` (or equivalent) file, add or modify the setting:
```xml
<security-constraints>
    <cookie>
        <secure>true</secure>
        <http-only>true</http-only>
    </cookie>
</security-constraints>
