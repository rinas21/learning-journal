# Git Stash Notes

## What is Git Stash?
Git stash is a command that temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can switch branches or pull updates without losing your work.

## Common Git Stash Commands

### 1. Save Uncommitted Changes
```sh
 git stash
```
This saves your uncommitted changes and reverts your working directory to the last committed state.

### 2. View Stashed Changes
```sh
git stash list
```
Lists all stashed changes with their stash index.

### 3. Apply the Most Recent Stash
```sh
git stash pop
```
Applies the most recent stash and removes it from the stash list.

### 4. Apply a Specific Stash Without Removing It
```sh
git stash apply stash@{index}
```
Applies a specific stash but keeps it in the stash list.

### 5. Drop a Specific Stash
```sh
git stash drop stash@{index}
```
Removes a specific stash from the stash list.

### 6. Clear All Stashes
```sh
git stash clear
```
Deletes all stashed changes permanently.

## Use Case Example
### Stash Changes Before Switching Branches
```sh
git stash
git checkout other-branch
git stash pop
```
This allows you to switch branches without committing unfinished work.

## Additional Notes
- Stashed changes are stored temporarily.
- Use `git stash pop` to apply and remove the latest stash.
- Use `git stash apply` to apply changes while keeping the stash.
