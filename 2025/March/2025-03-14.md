## Note on Handling Local Variables in Inner Classes (Java)

<p>When using local variables within an inner class or anonymous class, Java requires these variables to be final or effectively final (i.e., they should not be reassigned after initialization). This is because the `inner class` might outlive the scope of the local variable, and Java cannot guarantee that the variable's value will remain the same.</p>

### Key Points to Remember:

1. Declare variables final: If you need to access a local variable from within an inner or anonymous class, it must be declared as final.
2. Avoid reassigning variables: Once a local variable is used in an inner class, it cannot be reassigned, even if the variable is not explicitly declared final but is effectively final (i.e., not reassigned after initialization).

```
Example Fix:

```java
final String finalUrlString = "some_value";
final SomeType finalDrRequest = drRequest; // drRequest is now final

// Access these final variables inside the inner class
proxy.getInInterceptors().add(new AbstractPhaseInterceptor<Message>(Phase.RECEIVE) {
    @Override
    public void handleMessage(Message message) throws Fault {
        // Use final variables here
        logger.info("Request {} to {} with status", finalDrRequest, finalUrlString);
    }
});
```
This is a best practice to avoid compilation errors when using local variables within inner classes.
