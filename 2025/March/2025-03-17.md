### javap and its Use Case

javap is a command-line tool provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK) that disassembles Java class files. It allows you to view the bytecode of a class file and obtain details such as the version of the class file and other metadata.

## Use Case:
* The primary use case for javap is to inspect compiled .class files to understand their structure, such as methods, fields, and bytecode instructions. This is especially useful when you need to verify the compatibility of a class file with a specific Java version.

For example, you can use the following command to check the major version of a class file:

```bash
javap -v MyClass.class | grep "major version"
```

This will show the major version of the class file, which tells you which version of Java was used to compile the code.

### Major Version Table:

| Java Version | Major Version |
|--------------|---------------|
| Java 1.1     | 45            |
| Java 1.2     | 46            |
| Java 1.3     | 47            |
| Java 1.4     | 48            |
| Java 5       | 49            |
| Java 6       | 50            |
| Java 7       | 51            |
| Java 8       | 52            |
| Java 9       | 53            |
| Java 10      | 54            |
| Java 11      | 55            |
| Java 12      | 56            |
| Java 13      | 57            |
| Java 14      | 58            |
| Java 15      | 59            |
| Java 16      | 60            |
| Java 17      | 61            |
| Java 18      | 62            |
| Java 19      | 63            |

* Example:
If you run the following command on a class file:

```bash
javap -v /path/to/your/ClassFile.class | grep "major version"
```
It will output something like:

```bash
major version: 50
```
This means that the class file was compiled using Java 6 (major version 50).
