### Issue: Working with UTF-16 Encoded Files in Linux

#### Problem:
When trying to process a binary/encoded file (`IPG_APP1_DISK_old.log`), tools like `grep`, `strings`, and `less` don't return expected results. The file is identified as **UTF-16 encoding (little-endian)** with CRLF line terminators, causing issues when searching or processing with typical text-processing tools.

#### Solution:
To resolve the issue, the file needs to be **converted from UTF-16 to UTF-8 encoding**.

#### Steps to Fix:
1. **Convert the File from UTF-16 to UTF-8**:
   Use the `iconv` tool to convert the file encoding to UTF-8:
```bash
   iconv -f UTF-16 -t UTF-8 IPG_APP1_DISK_old.log > IPG_APP1_DISK_old_utf8.log
```
* -f UTF-16: Specifies the input encoding as UTF-16.
* -t UTF-8: Specifies the output encoding as UTF-8.

#### The converted file will be saved as IPG_APP1_DISK_old_utf8.log.
* Verify the File Encoding: After converting the file, verify the encoding with the file command:

```bash
file IPG_APP1_DISK_old_utf8.log
```
#### Ensure it now shows UTF-8.

### Search the Converted File: Now that the file is in UTF-8 format, use standard text-processing tools like grep to search for specific terms (e.g., "hms"):

```bash
grep "hms" IPG_APP1_DISK_old_utf8.log
```

* Alternatively, extract printable strings and search with strings:

```bash
strings IPG_APP1_DISK_old_utf8.log | grep "hms"
```

* Why This Happens:
UTF-16 encoding may cause issues with text-processing tools, which expect the file to be in more common formats like UTF-8 or ASCII.
iconv is a versatile tool for encoding conversion and is helpful when dealing with files that have non-standard encodings.
