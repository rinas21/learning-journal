# Rsync and Its Usages

## What is Rsync?
Rsync (Remote Sync) is a fast and versatile command-line tool for copying and synchronizing files and directories between locations. It efficiently transfers only the differences between the source and destination, making it ideal for backups and file synchronization.

## Basic Rsync Syntax
```bash
rsync [options] source destination
```

## Common Rsync Options
- `-a` (archive mode): Preserves symbolic links, file permissions, timestamps, and directory structure.
- `-v` (verbose): Displays the progress and details of file transfers.
- `-r` (recursive): Copies directories and their contents.
- `-u` (update): Copies only files that are newer in the source.
- `--progress`: Shows progress during transfer.
- `--ignore-existing`: Skips files that already exist in the destination.
- `--delete`: Removes files in the destination that no longer exist in the source.
- `-z` (compress): Compresses file data during transfer to reduce bandwidth usage.

## Example Usages
### 1. Copy missing files from source to destination
```bash
rsync -av --ignore-existing /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
This ensures that only new files (not present in the destination) are copied.

### 2. Sync files while preserving attributes
```bash
rsync -av /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
This maintains file permissions, symbolic links, and timestamps.

### 3. Sync and remove deleted files from the destination
```bash
rsync -av --delete /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
This ensures that the destination is an exact mirror of the source.

### 4. Copy files over SSH
```bash
rsync -av -e ssh /source/directory/ user@remote_host:/destination/directory/
```
This allows secure file transfers over an SSH connection.

### 5. Show file transfer progress
```bash
rsync -av --progress /source/directory/ /destination/directory/
```
Displays progress details for each file being transferred.

## Conclusion
Rsync is a powerful tool for file synchronization, backups, and mirroring. It is widely used in system administration, scripting, and data management due to its efficiency and reliability.
