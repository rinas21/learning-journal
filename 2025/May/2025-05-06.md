# 🔐 View Saved Wi-Fi Passwords on Ubuntu

You can view previously connected Wi-Fi passwords by accessing the NetworkManager configuration files.

## 📁 Step-by-Step Guide

1. **List all saved Wi-Fi profiles:**
    ```bash
    ls /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
    ```

2. **View the contents of a specific Wi-Fi profile:**
    ```bash
    sudo cat "/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<WiFi-NAME>.nmconnection"
    ```
    Replace `<WiFi-NAME>` with the actual name of the Wi-Fi profile (file name).

3. **Locate the password:**
    Look for the line containing:
    ```
    psk=your_wifi_password
    ```

### 🔒 Note:
- Root access (`sudo`) is required to read these files.
- These files are stored in `.nmconnection` format on modern Ubuntu versions using NetworkManager.
