# 📁 File Permissions in Linux (Owner, Group, Others)

In Linux/Unix, each file and directory has permissions assigned to three types of users:

## 👤 1. Owner (User)
- The person who **created the file** or has been assigned ownership.
- Can read/write/execute based on `chmod`.
- Ownership can be changed with:  
    ```bash
    chown username filename
    ```

## 👥 2. Group
- A group of users who may share access.
- If you're part of the file's group, you get the group-level permissions.
- Group can be changed with:  
    ```bash
    chgrp groupname filename
    ```

## 🌍 3. Others (World)
- Everyone else not the owner and not in the group.
- Public users on the system.

## 🔢 chmod Numeric Permissions
Each permission type (read, write, execute) is represented by a number:

| Permission | Value | Symbol |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Read       | 4     | r      |
| Write      | 2     | w      |
| Execute    | 1     | x      |

Add them to get the total:

- `7 = rwx` (read + write + execute)
- `6 = rw-` (read + write)
- `5 = r-x` (read + execute)
- `4 = r--` (read only)
- `0 = ---` (no access)

### Example: `chmod 754 file.txt`
| User Type | Value | Meaning          |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Owner     | 7     | rwx              |
| Group     | 5     | r-x              |
| Others    | 4     | r--              |

## ⚠️ Common `chmod` Values
| Command     | Meaning                                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `chmod 777` | Everyone can read/write/execute             |
| `chmod 755` | Owner: all, Group/Others: read + execute     |
| `chmod 644` | Owner: read + write, Group/Others: read only |
| `chmod 600` | Only owner can read/write                   |
| `chmod 666` | All can read/write, no execute              |

> **🔒 Note:** Be careful with `chmod 777` – it gives full control to everyone, which can pose a security risk. Use it only when absolutely necessary.
