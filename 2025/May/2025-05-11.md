### Note:
The error `configure: error: pcre(2)-config for libpcre not found. PCRE is required and available from http://pcre.org/` indicates that the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library is missing on your system. This library is required to compile the Apache HTTP Server.

#### Steps to Resolve:
1. **Install the PCRE development package**:
    - On Ubuntu/Debian, run:
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install libpcre3-dev
      ```

2. **Optional Dependencies**:
    - If you also want HTTP/2 and SSL support, install additional dependencies:
      ```bash
      sudo apt install build-essential libpcre3-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
      ```

3. **Reconfigure and Compile**:
    - After installing the required dependencies, rerun the `./configure` command with the desired flags. For example:
      ```bash
      ./configure --enable-proxy --enable-proxy-http --enable-ssl --enable-rewrite
      ```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to proceed with the compilation of Apache HTTP Server.


### Resolving the `ServerName` Warning in Apache

The warning `AH00558: httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message` occurs when Apache cannot determine the server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and defaults to `127.0.1.1`.

#### Steps to Resolve:
1. **Edit Apache's Configuration File**:
  - Open the Apache configuration file. Depending on your setup, it could be:
    - `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` (Ubuntu/Debian)
    - `/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf` (custom installations)
  - Use a text editor to open the file. For example:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    ```

2. **Add the `ServerName` Directive**:
  - At the end of the configuration file, add the following line:
    ```apache
    ServerName localhost
    ```
  - If you have a specific domain name, replace `localhost` with your FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

3. **Save and Exit**:
  - Press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and finally `Enter` to save and exit the editor.

4. **Restart Apache**:
  - Apply the changes by restarting Apache:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```
  - If you're using a custom installation, restart Apache with:
    ```bash
    ./apachectl -k restart
    ```

This should resolve the warning and ensure Apache uses the specified `ServerName`.
