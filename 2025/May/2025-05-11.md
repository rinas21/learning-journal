### Note:
The error `configure: error: pcre(2)-config for libpcre not found. PCRE is required and available from http://pcre.org/` indicates that the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library is missing on your system. This library is required to compile the Apache HTTP Server.

#### Steps to Resolve:
1. **Install the PCRE development package**:
    - On Ubuntu/Debian, run:
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install libpcre3-dev
      ```

2. **Optional Dependencies**:
    - If you also want HTTP/2 and SSL support, install additional dependencies:
      ```bash
      sudo apt install build-essential libpcre3-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
      ```

3. **Reconfigure and Compile**:
    - After installing the required dependencies, rerun the `./configure` command with the desired flags. For example:
      ```bash
      ./configure --enable-proxy --enable-proxy-http --enable-ssl --enable-rewrite
      ```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to proceed with the compilation of Apache HTTP Server.
