# Ruby on Rails Installation Notes (2025-05-19)

## ✅ Step 1: Install Ruby (already done)
Verify Ruby and gem are installed:
```bash
ruby -v
gem -v
```
If not installed:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```

---

## ✅ Step 2: Add Ruby Gems bin directory to PATH

If you see a warning about missing `~/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin` in your PATH, add it:

**For Bash:**
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**For Zsh:**
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Install Rails using gem

```bash
gem install --user-install rails
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Verify Rails installation

```bash
rails -v
```
If you get "command not found," check your PATH as in Step 2.

---

## ✅ Step 5: (Optional) Install Node.js and Yarn

Rails needs Node.js and Yarn for JavaScript and package management.

**Install via apt:**
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs yarnpkg
```

**Or use nvm for latest Node.js:**
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install --lts
```

---

## 🏁 Done! Create a new Rails app

```bash
rails new myapp
cd myapp
rails server
```
