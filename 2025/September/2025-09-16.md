# Disabling the Pager in `psql` for the `postgres` User

Great! It looks like you successfully created the `.psqlrc` file in the `postgres` user's home directory (`/var/lib/postgresql/`) and confirmed that the pager is now disabled when running `psql` as the `postgres` user. The message "Pager usage is off" confirms that the configuration is working as expected.

## Summary of What You Did

1.  **Switched to the `postgres` user:**
    ```bash
    sudo -i -u postgres
    ```

2.  **Created the `.psqlrc` file** in the `postgres` user's home directory and added the line:
    ```sql
    \pset pager off
    ```

3.  **Verified the configuration** by running `psql` and confirming that the pager is disabled.

This is a good solution for ensuring that `psql` doesn't use a pager when run by the `postgres` user, which can be helpful for scripting or automated tasks where interactive paging is undesirable.
